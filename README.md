Work flow:

We read the exercise, devided the work between us and began working on the project. 
Everyone wrote their tasks on the JIRA and updated as they went along. We checked up on each other every few days to ensure everybody is advancing. 
We wrote the servers logic and when all of the server requests were written, we started adding the functionalities to the web part. We wrote functionalities for users, friends and posts so everything is synced up between the web and the android even after exiting the page / app.
