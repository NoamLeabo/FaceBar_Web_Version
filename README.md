# Foobar_p2_web
Welcome to the web version of Facebar!

How to run our project?

Download zip from Github - extract folder and then:
1. npm i
2. npm start

Work flow:

We started by reading the exercise a few times and understanding what we need to do. 
We devided the work between us and began working on it.
Everyone wrote his tasks on the JIRA and updated what he was working on.
Everyone worked on his part and we assured every few days with the other team mates that everyone is advancing.
After everyone already had his part working we started to see how to merge similar compenents to have less code that does the same.
Then we started merging pages together to work on navigations between different screens.
First the login and subscribe screens were merged together and we refactored same code that has been written beacuse 2 different people 
have written these 2 screens.
At the end the feed screen was merged with the 2 other screens and refactoring was done to make all different thing work

IV - FaceBar is not yet available for the wide public. Thus, everyone that signs in probably knows each and every one that registered. We show you all of them as contacts, so you can see some familiar faces apart from your favorite composers.

V - These features are not available in the current version of FaceBar but soon enough you will be able to access the full power and diversity of the platform.

IX - The comment section of a post is an excelent way to let the creator of a post and everyone else that has seen it what you think about it. Chopin would be very happy to know how much you like his pieces!

X - Another way you can show your appreciation of a post is by liking it.

XI - Because FaceBar is still a very exclusive website, you are able to practice sending a post to another platform but you won't be able to actually send it.

Adding a comment is pretty intuitive - click on the text area, write your thoughts and click the blue send button.

Notice that you can't post a comment without any text, because saying nothing isn't saying much.
