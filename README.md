The new Facebar is here, with tons of new features!

The new profilepage lets you see all of your friend’s posts and even their friends! You can send a friend request to any user through their profilepage, and accept / reject a friend request through your page (The friend is added only if the receiving user accepted).

You can access a profilepage by cliking on the contact card of the user in your contacts area.

Work flow:

We read the exercise, devided the work between us and began working on the project. 
Everyone wrote their tasks on the JIRA and updated as they went along. We checked up on each other every few days to ensure everybody is advancing. 
We wrote the servers logic and when all of the server requests were written, we started adding the functionalities to the web part. We wrote functionalities for users, friends and posts so everything is synced up between the web and the android even after exiting the page / app.
