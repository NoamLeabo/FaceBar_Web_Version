Work flow:

We started by reading the exercide a few times and understanding what we need to do. 
We devided the work between us and began working on it.
Everyone wrote his tasks on the JIRA and updated what he was working on.
Everyone worked on his part and we assured every few days with the other team mates that everyone is advancing.
After everyone already had his part working we started to see how to merge similar compenents to have less code that does the same.
Then we started merging pages together to work on navigations between different screens.
