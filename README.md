The new Facebar is here, with tons of new features!

The new profilepage lets you see all of your friendâ€™s posts and their friends. You can send a friend request to any user through their profilepage, and accept / reject a friend request through your page.

The users page lets you see every user on Facebar so you can find your friends or make new ones. 

You can edit your information or delete your user entirely if you feel like it. Access this window by clicking on your prifilepicture on the top right side of the screen.
